# Procedural Terrain Generation Demo
 This is a unity project the simulates procedural terrain generation mainly following Sebastian Lague's tutorial series on youtube.
 
 This requires unity 2020.1.11f1 to run.

 With the project open, you can click on the "play" button to playtest the project.
 -WASD or arrows to move
 -Space to move upwards
 -"F" to go downwards

 In the hierarchy section you can click on the object "Map Generation" and look at the inspector tab to see the Map Generation Script. There you can find a variety of options that customize the terrain generation.


All scripts are avaiable in this unity project.

This was done in other to complete my monography "USOS DA GERAÇÃO PROCEDURAL E MODELAGEM 3D PARA CRIAÇÃO DE TERRENOS EM JOGOS DIGITAIS"..
